## Instructor: [Ashraff Hathibelagal][instructor url]

These days, as an application developer, you can't limit yourself to conventional programming techniques alone! Deep neural networks and machine learning are becoming a part of mainstream software. This means more and more users are starting to expect their apps and devices to be capable of recognizing patterns and making decisions in much the same way as humans do.

Fortunately, with TensorFlow, a fast, powerful, and open-source machine learning framework developed by Google, working with deep learning algorithms is far easier than you may think. In this short course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Ashraff Hathibelagal shows you how to create, train, and evaluate a variety of deep neural networks using TensorFlow's high-level Keras API.
