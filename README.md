As an application developer, you can't limit yourself to conventional programming techniques these days. Deep neural networks are slowly becoming a part of mainstream software, primarily because more and more users are starting to expect their apps and devices to be capable of recognizing patterns and making decisions in much the same way as humans do.

Fortunately, with TensorFlow, a fast, powerful, and open-source machine learning framework developed by Google, working with deep learning algorithms is far easier than you think. In this short course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Ashraff Hathibelagal shows you how to create, train, and evaluate a variety of deep neural networks using TensorFlow's high-level Keras API.
